It specifically calls to mind a formal robe with long sleeves held together by a sash called an obi. Both the robe and the obi can have several layers, depending on aesthetic and formality considerations. The robe itself usually has a colorful pattern. In the episode, Saiko wears a dark blue kimono with blocky strokes of purple and yellow. She is also wearing a white under robe called a nagajuban. Her obi sash is black with a yellow chrysanthemum print. A red cord called an obijime is tied around the obi to secure it so that it doesn't open. Under the obi is a green bustle called an obiage, which adds support so it doesn't slide up and down. Each piece alone is understated, with a little traditional, a little modern, a little subdued, a little vibrant. Collectively, it makes her looks refined and dignified, but in an unexpected way.",
